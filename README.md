# Monitest API

This is an example project that demonstrates the usage of Express, TypeScript, and Mongoose to build a server application with three models: `User`, `Wallet`, and `Transaction`. The server allows transfers between wallets and funding via Paystack.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Monitest

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```shell
   npm install

3. Configure environment variables:

Create a .env file in the project root and provide the necessary configuration variables. For example: as also seen in .env.example 
   ```shell
      MONGO_URI= 
      JWT_SECRET=
      JWT_EXPIREII=
      AXIOSBASEURL=
      PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=
      CALLBACK_URL=
      PORT=3000
   ```

4. Build the TypeScript code:
   ```shell
   npm run build

5. Start the server
   ```shell
   npm start
